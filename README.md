this is a fully working web app in a MERN stack 

it contains 3 diffent containers to demonstrate fully working apps 

it has a mongo db database , a node js frontend and a js backend as well . it has a api router to map the connection between frontend and backend to have a fully working app.
it can fully CRUD data in the database and can be used with docker watch command to update changes to all containers in real time without need of restarting the ontainers. 

if you need to implant such a stack as shown above you can contact me via email to tarichiali@gmail.com .
